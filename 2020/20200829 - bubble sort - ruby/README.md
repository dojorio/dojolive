## Challenge

Bubble sort!
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort

First Pass
    ( 5 1 4 2 8 ) â†’ ( 1 5 4 2 8 ), Here, algorithm compares the first two elements, and swaps since 5 > 1.
    ( 1 5 4 2 8 ) â†’ ( 1 4 5 2 8 ), Swap since 5 > 4
    ( 1 4 5 2 8 ) â†’ ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Swap since 5 > 2
    ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) â†’ ( 1 4 2 5 8 ), Now, since these elements are already in order (8 > 5), algorithm does not swap them.
Second Pass
    ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) â†’ ( 1 4 2 5 8 )
    ( 1 4 2 5 8 ) â†’ ( 1 2 4 5 8 ), Swap since 4 > 2
    ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) â†’ ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
    ( 1 2 4 5 8 ) â†’ ( 1 2 4 5 8 )
